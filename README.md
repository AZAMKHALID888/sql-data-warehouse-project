# sql-data-warehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics

Welcome to my take on the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! This hands-on initiative walks through creating a full end-to-end data solution, starting from constructing a robust data warehouse all the way to extracting meaningful, actionable insights. As a portfolio showcase, it spotlights key industry standards in data engineering and analytics. 

I'm tackling this project inspired by the excellent tutorial from Data with Baraa – his "SQL Data Warehouse from Scratch | Full Hands-On Data Engineering Project" video series provided a fantastic blueprint to build upon.

📋 Project Overview
This project merges data engineering and analytics to transform raw sales information into strategic intelligence. By leveraging SQL Server, we consolidate disparate data sources, ensure top-notch quality, and craft queries that reveal patterns in customer interactions, product success, and market shifts.

🔧 Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering Focus)
🎯 Goal
Construct a scalable, modern data warehouse on SQL Server to unify sales records from multiple origins. This setup powers advanced reporting and supports data-driven choices for the business.

📝 Key Specs
Data Ingestion: Pull in datasets from ERP and CRM systems, delivered as CSV files, to kickstart the pipeline.
Data Cleansing: Scrub and fix any inconsistencies or errors in the raw data before it hits the warehouse – quality first!
Integration Layer: Fuse the two streams into one cohesive, intuitive data model tailored for efficient analytical queries.
Scope Note: We're zeroing in on the most recent dataset; no need for complex historical partitioning here.
Documentation: Include straightforward guides on the data model to make it accessible for business users and fellow analysts alike.

📊 BI Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics Focus)
🎯 Goal
Harness SQL queries to uncover granular details across three core areas:
Customer Behavior: Dive into purchasing habits and engagement levels.
Product Performance: Evaluate sales velocity, top performers, and underachievers.
Sales Trends: Spot seasonal patterns, growth trajectories, and forecasting signals.

These deliverables arm stakeholders with vital KPIs, fueling smarter strategies and proactive decisions.
